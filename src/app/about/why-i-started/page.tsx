              When she was just one year old, due to work pressure, I made the heartbreaking decision to send her back to China to be cared for by relatives. But when she turned two, a nightmare struck—she suddenly became gravely ill, experiencing seizures, foaming at the mouth, and a dangerously unstable condition. My family rushed her to the hospital, but the doctors couldn't identify the cause, nor provide any effective treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even worse, the seizures didn't stop—they returned several more times in the following days. As a mother, I was devastated. Sleepless nights became routine, and I was filled with guilt and fear.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually, we managed to consult with a highly respected medical professor. After carefully reviewing all the reports and test results, she fell silent for a moment and then gently said:
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl italic text-center my-8">
              "If she has another episode, it could lead to permanent brain damage."
            </p>
            <p>
              That sentence hit me like a bolt of lightning. It shattered the last bit of strength I was clinging to.
            </p>
            <p>
              But it also became the turning point. I told myself: I can no longer rely on others—I have to protect her future with my own hands.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started with food. I dove into research on child nutrition and therapeutic diets. I carefully selected every ingredient and prepared all her meals by hand. I insisted on using only natural, additive-free ingredients, and completely cut out takeout and processed foods. For two full years, Anna didn't eat a single bite of outside food.
            </p>
            <p>
              I observed her daily, recorded her reactions, and continuously adjusted her nutritional plan—giving her every chance to recover.
            </p>
            <p>
              And then, a miracle happened.
            </p>
            <p>
              The seizures stopped. She slowly regained strength, and her smile returned. In time, she made a full recovery.
            </p>
            <p>
              Doctors couldn't explain what had changed. But I knew.
              <br />
              It was nutrition. And love.
              <br />
              Healthy food and a mother's unwavering care had brought her back from the edge.
